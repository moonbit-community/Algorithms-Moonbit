# Pzl-love/shell_sort
shell sorting is a type of insertion sorting, which is an improvement on the direct insertion sorting algorithm.
It does this by comparing elements at a certain interval from each other,
and the distance used for each comparison decreases as the algorithm progresses, until only the last order of adjacent elements is compared.
